# DSCRTP
This repository uses version 1 of the DSCRTP inventory. The inventory details proejcts funded by NOAA's Deep-sea Coral Research and Technology Program (DSCRTP) from 2009-2022. Each project includes information on the NOAA offices involved, regions included, funding information, methods used, proposed objectives, and unplanned deliverables. The purpose of this repository is to create a dashboard visualizing the DSCRTP inventory using RShiny. 
Here is a change.
