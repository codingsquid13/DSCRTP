## R Markdown


Read in the datasheet 
```{r}
#Load the required library 
library(googlesheets4)
library(dplyr)

#Read google sheets data into R
dsc <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ndur-uZ5D-YHnGYjh913t4OM76X-GrWuS1-y2XazLSs/edit?usp=sharing") %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.list), as.character))
```


Set up subset of dataset to work with 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

#Remove columns with character values/ notes & links 
dsc1<- subset(dsc, select= -c(POC, DSC_website, source, cruise_report_site_char))

#Include only proejcts from the PAC (82 projects)
dsc2<-dsc1[dsc1$PAC == '1', ]

#Replace ?, ??, ?? with NAs
dsc2[ dsc2 == c("?", "??", "???") ] <- NA

# Get rid of dollar signs
dsc2$cost = as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", dsc2$cost))

#Replace NA values with 0
dsc2$cost[is.na(dsc2$cost)] <- 0


```

Set up the framework of the dashboard by creating a ui. 

```{r}
library(shiny)

# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui_dsc <- fluidPage(

  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Shiny Barplot"),

  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(

    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(

      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                  label = "Number of bins:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30)

    ),

    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(

      # Output: Histogram ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")

    )
  )
)

```

Create a server that will be used as a function to run plots in the ui framework. 

```{r}
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server_dsc <- function(input, output) {

  # Histogram of the Old Faithful Geyser Data ----
  # with requested number of bins
  # This expression that generates a histogram is wrapped in a call
  # to renderPlot to indicate that:
  #
  # 1. It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically
  #    re-executed when inputs (input$bins) change
  # 2. Its output type is a plot
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({

    x    <- dsc2$cost 
    bins <- seq(min(x),  max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = "#75AADB", border = "white",
         xlab = "Funds Alloted by DSCRTP ($)",
         main = "Histogram of Project Funding Amount")

    })

}
```


Render the dashboard
```{r}
dsc2$cost<- dsc2$cost / (10^3) #I did this because the values were so large it was difficult to interpret

library(shiny)
shinyApp(ui = ui_dsc, server = server_dsc)

#moving forward I think that I would like to make the scale bar adjustable by year, not the number of bins that can be created... or perhaps in addition to 
```


Attempt 2 to set up a US map: 


Below are the regions that are the U.S Regional Fishery Managament Council regions. 
- Pacific (PAC): Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California
- North Pacific (NP): Alaska
- Western Pacific (WP): Hawaii
- Gulf of Mexico (GOM): Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida (1/2)
- South Atlantic (SA): Florida (1/2), Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina (1/2)
- Mid Atlantic (MA): North Carolina (1/2), Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Deleware, New York
- New England (NE): Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Isalnd, New Hampshire, Maine
- Caribbean: Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands 

```{r}

*PAC*
```{r}
###RUN THE BELOW THREE LINES OF CODE TOGETHER TO FORM PAC DATASET########
#this creates a dataset with only PAC data in it
pacdata<- dsc2[which(dsc2$PAC=="1")] %>% #only include PAC data 
  dplyr::select(start_FY, PAC, cost) %>%
  group_by(start_FY) %>% #group the data by year
  summarise(num=n(),
            totalcost=sum(cost)) 
#This is creating a new column called region, I am filling it with PAC
state<- "CA"
pacdata$state<- state

#Rename the "PAC" column to "num_projects"
pacdata<- pacdata %>%
  rename("num_projects" = "num")

```

```





```{r}
#First: create the initial data 
coral<-dsc2 %>% dplyr::select(start_FY, NE, MA, SA, CAR, GM, PAC, WP, NP, cost) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c("NE", "MA", "SA", "CAR", "GM", "PAC", "WP", "NP"),

               names_transform= ,
               values_to= "presence")
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
